Since his last album, he scored the Emmy to secure his EGOT, had a second child with model Chrissy Teigen, was awarded an honorary doctorate at Berklee College of Music, and was named Sexiest Man Alive. The album he recorded amid all the success, Bigger Love, is correspondingly upbeat and joyous. He describes it as \u201cvintage sounds with a modern sensibility,\u201d in keeping with a longstanding personal mandate, using love songs as a bridge between the old and new. With this incredibly on-the-nose title, he reminds us both of his devotion to his muse and his limitations: Love might be fathomless, but Legend\u2019s appreciation of it is pretty shallow.</p><p>Legend believes in the power of love the way some believe in Christmas spirit\u2014as a transmissible, irresistible force that extinguishes all negativity. Fittingly, the album reunites him with producer Raphael Saadiq, who was behind his 2018 Christmas album. Legend is pegging his new album, which was recorded primarily in 2019, as a sort of balm for the times. \u201cA lot was going on, but I still felt like people need some uplifting music,\u201d he told Oprah Magazine. \u201cHopefully it can help them get through what\u2019s been a tough spring, and hopefully this music will help them have a better summer.\u201d Bigger Love is rife with this feel-good energy, buoyed by his stately voice and easygoing charm, but beneath its positive exterior is an emptiness that\u2019s hard to ignore.</p><p>His last album, 2016\u2019s Blake Mills-produced Darkness and Light, had a personality and intimacy that eluded him on previous albums. He was inhabiting songs as a person and not just a dutiful soul man treating the piano bench like a cubicle. They never quite conjured a \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On,\u201d as they hoped, but Mills brought character to his music. The everymanisms of Love in the Future were replaced with personal reflections, confessions of a \u201cFaceTime abuser,\u201d and the politically minded expressiveness of a man clinging to hope in a darkening world; Legend\u2019s songs were suddenly richer and more textured.</p><p>Bigger Love reverts to a vacant pantomime and a less robust R&B palette courtesy of producers like Oak, Ryan Tedder, and Ricky Reed. His 2019 protest song, \u201cPreach,\u201d is curiously absent here; so, too, is the effortless tonal blend of the album\u2019s predecessor. This marriage of vintage and modern goes awry, as Bigger Love opens with a trap take on doo-wop and closes with a Mr. Hudson ballad. Following the lead of his Oscar partner Common, Bigger Love is risk-averse and platitudinous. There\u2019s a derivative YOLO song called \u201cOne Life\u201d and the hook couldn\u2019t be more uninspired: \u201cWe\u2019ve got one life/I won\u2019t waste it, one life/I\u2019m gon\u2019 taste the joy in every minute/Beginning\u2019 \u2018til the finish,\u201d he sings. Not even Anderson .Paak\u2019s smooth funk can save it. If the album\u2019s tacky acoustic lead single, \u201cConversations in the Dark,\u201d sounds like a not-so-subtle sync for a tear-jerker network drama, that\u2019s because it pretty much is.</p><p>No song here is transcendent enough to join \u201cAll of Me\u201d in wedding-first-dance canon, nor is there a moment as touching and emotionally honest as \u201cRight By You (for Luna),\u201d the song he wrote for his newborn daughter on Darkness and Light, where he wonders aloud how she\u2019ll receive and be received by the world, the quiver in his tone carrying a father\u2019s anxiety. \u201cActions\u201d fails to live up to its brazen \u201cThe Edge\u201d sample, so clearly repurposed to call to mind Dr. Dre\u2019s \u201cThe Next Episode\u201d that its appeal is lost to sense memory, and the song\u2019s core directive (\u201cactions speak louder than love songs\u201d) goes largely unheeded.</p><p>Even working within the confines of his safe space, though, John Legend can remind you why Kanye built a label around him, and Bigger Love is sustained by such moments. He works well in collaboration with bluesman Gary Clark Jr. (\u201cWild\u201d), psychedelic R&B singer Jhen\xe9 Aiko (\u201cU Move, I Move\u201d), rap technician Rapsody (\u201cRemember Us\u201d), and reggae artist Koffee (\u201cDon\u2019t Walk Away\u201d) on tracks that stretch his songcraft in different directions\u2014anthemic pop rock, alt-R&B, neo soul, and dancehall lite. The attempts are bold by his standards, and he slots into each one confidently. \u201cFavorite Place\u201d is the kind of sexy-time jam befitting a new dad. He plays to his strengths on \u201cSlow Cooker,\u201d a quirky little song that likens brimming sensuality to the simmer of a crock-pot, letting the resonance of his timbre give shape to his phrases. On the understated \u201cFocused,\u201d the confusion produced by a noisy outside world falls away when under his wife\u2019s thrall. Plain and folksy, it has the characteristics of a Bill Withers song: The simplicity of the lyrics mirrors how uncomplicated things are in her company. Suddenly, the uplifting power he\u2019s been preaching about is in full effect.</p>","prices":{"regular":21,"premium":18},"tags":["Funk","Soul","Contemporary","R&B"],"tracks":{"A":[{"title":"Song Machine: Strange Timez","subtitle":"Featuring Robert Smith","duration":"3:48"},{"title":"The Valley of the Pagans","subtitle":"Featuring Beck","duration":"3:00"},{"title":"The Lost Chord","subtitle":"Featuring Schoolboy Q","duration":"4:03"},{"title":"Pac-Man","subtitle":"Featuring featuring Schoolboy Q","duration":"3:12"},{"title":"Chalk Tablet Towers","subtitle":"Featuring St. Vincent","duration":"3:02"},{"title":"The Pink Phantom","subtitle":"Featuring Elton John and 6lack","duration":"4:13"}],"B":[{"title":"Aries","subtitle":"Featuring Peter Hook and Georgia","duration":"4:14"},{"title":"Friday 13th","subtitle":"Featuring Octavian","duration":"3:37"},{"title":"Dead Butterflies","subtitle":"Featuring Kano and Roxani Arias","duration":"4:33"},{"title":"D\xe9sol\xe9 (Extended version)","subtitle":"Featuring Fatoumata Diawara","duration":"5:33"},{"title":"Momentary Bliss","subtitle":"Featuring Slowthai and Slaves","duration":"3:43"}]},"categories":["recent","top"]},{"image":"demo_44.jpg","title":"Live At Montreux 1983 & 1990","author":"John Lee Hooker & The Coast To Coast Blues Band","releaseDate":"2020-11-06","label":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","format":"2 x Vinyl, LP, Album, 180 grs.","disks":2,"excerpt":"<p>The John Lee Hooker Estate does the world\u2019s blues fans a solid by releasing the posthumous double-live set John Lee Hooker Live at Montreux 1983 & 1990.</p>","desc":"<p>The John Lee Hooker Estate does the world\u2019s blues fans a solid by releasing the posthumous double-live set John Lee Hooker Live at Montreux 1983 & 1990. The album drops November 6th, 2020 thanks to Eagle Rock Entertainment and will be available as a 2-LP set, digital video, and digital audio. The record captures Hooker at his boogie-king best in two distinct performances at the legendary Montreux Jazz Festival in 1983 and 1990, rocking the joint with the help of The Coast To Coast Blues Band and guest appearances by the late guitarist Luther Allison and Grammy-winning harmonica star Sugar Blue. Located in Switzerland, the Montreux Jazz Festival is one of the world\u2019s biggest and longest-running jazz festivals and hearing this lineup of blues royalty heating up its stage is a musical indulgence of the highest order.</p><p>Four-time Grammy Award winner and Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award recipient John Lee Hooker will always be remembered as one of the most unique and compelling artists that blues music has ever produced. His debut single, \u201cBoogie Chillen,\u201d rose to #1 on the R&B charts in 1949, selling over a million copies. Hooker was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. In 2008, \u201cBoogie Chillen\u201d was added to the National Recording Registry by the Library Of Congress as a song that is \u201cculturally, historically, or aesthetically important, and/or inform(s) or reflect(s) life in the United States.\u201d Hooker instinctively recast the blues in his own image, doing away with the restrictive 12-bar structure and taking the music to a deeper, funkier, and more personal place. He has influenced every generation of musicians to follow him and his artistic DNA has become immortal.</p><p>The 1983 show kicks off with a simmering version of Hooker\u2019s mid-60s single \u201cServes Me Right To Suffer.\u201d The Coast To Coast Blues Band puts down John Lee\u2019s signature style of hypnotic rhythm behind him and Hooker works his minimalist magic on the assembled fans. The Hook has always defined what cool is all about and that presence is in full force here from the moment he hits the stage. He\u2019s vibrant and captivating and the Montreux crowd clearly can\u2019t get enough.</p><p>From there, Hooker leads the band and audience through a high-spirited set of his hits and other classics. His funked-out take on Tommy Tucker\u2019s eternal \u201cHi-Heel Sneakers\u201d morphs the 12-bar standard into a trance-inducing pressure cooker drenched in Hooker\u2019s personality and shows off the jamming ability of the group backing him. Of course, Hooker throws down all of his crowd-pleasers, including \u201cBoom Boom,\u201d \u201cCrawlin\u2019 King Snake,\u201d and  \u201cBoogie Chillen,\u201d the latter of which gets stretched into an epic 17-minute blaster that features Luther Allison, Sugar Blue, and an amazing horn section. The show is definitely one of those nights meant to be captured and saved for the ages and upholds every bit of Hooker\u2019s practically mythical stature.</p>","prices":{"regular":29,"premium":21},"tags":["Funk","Soul","Contemporary","R&B"],"tracks":{"A":[{"title":"It Serves Me Right To Suffer","subtitle":"","duration":"3:48"},{"title":"I Didn\'t Know","subtitle":"","duration":"3:00"},{"title":"Hi-Heel Sneakers","subtitle":"","duration":"4:03"},{"title":"If You Take Care Of Me, I\'ll Take Care Of You","subtitle":"","duration":"3:12"},{"title":"Boom Boom","subtitle":"","duration":"3:02"}],"B":[{"title":"Worried Life Blues","subtitle":"","duration":"4:14"},{"title":"I\'m Jealous","subtitle":"","duration":"3:37"},{"title":"Crawlin\' King Snake","subtitle":"","duration":"4:33"},{"title":"Boogie Chillen\'","subtitle":"","duration":"5:33"}],"C":[{"title":"John Lee Hooker Introduction","subtitle":"","duration":"4:14"},{"title":"Mabel","subtitle":"","duration":"3:37"},{"title":"I\'m In The Mood","subtitle":"","duration":"4:33"},{"title":"Crawlin\' King Snake\'","subtitle":"","duration":"5:33"},{"title":"Baby Lee\'","subtitle":"","duration":"5:33"}],"D":[{"title":"It Serves Me Right To Suffer","subtitle":"","duration":"4:14"},{"title":"Boom Boom","subtitle":"","duration":"3:37"},{"title":"The Healer","subtitle":"","duration":"4:33"},{"title":"Boogie Chillen","subtitle":"","duration":"5:33"}]},"categories":["recent","top"]},{"image":"demo_45.jpg","title":"Johnny Cash & The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra","author":"Johnny Cash & The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra","releaseDate":"2020-11-13","label":"Columbia, Sony Music","format":"2 x Vinyl, LP, Album, 180 grs.","disks":1,"excerpt":"<p>I know my father would be enormously excited to see this new album become a reality.

The album drops November 6th, 2020 thanks to Eagle Rock Entertainment and will be available as a 2-LP set, digital video, and digital audio. The record captures Hooker at his boogie-king best in two distinct performances at the legendary Montreux Jazz Festival in 1983 and 1990, rocking the joint with the help of The Coast To Coast Blues Band and guest appearances by the late guitarist Luther Allison and Grammy-winning harmonica star Sugar Blue. Located in Switzerland, the Montreux Jazz Festival is one of the world\u2019s biggest and longest-running jazz festivals and hearing this lineup of blues royalty heating up its stage is a musical indulgence of the highest order.</p><p>Four-time Grammy Award winner and Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award recipient John Lee Hooker will always be remembered as one of the most unique and compelling artists that blues music has ever produced. His debut single, \u201cBoogie Chillen,\u201d rose to #1 on the R&B charts in 1949, selling over a million copies. Hooker was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. In 2008, \u201cBoogie Chillen\u201d was added to the National Recording Registry by the Library Of Congress as a song that is \u201cculturally, historically, or aesthetically important, and/or inform(s) or reflect(s) life in the United States.\u201d Hooker instinctively recast the blues in his own image, doing away with the restrictive 12-bar structure and taking the music to a deeper, funkier, and more personal place. He has influenced every generation of musicians to follow him and his artistic DNA has become immortal.</p><p>The 1983 show kicks off with a simmering version of Hooker\u2019s mid-60s single \u201cServes Me Right To Suffer.\u201d The Coast To Coast Blues Band puts down John Lee\u2019s signature style of hypnotic rhythm behind him and Hooker works his minimalist magic on the assembled fans. The Hook has always defined what cool is all about and that presence is in full force here from the moment he hits the stage. He\u2019s vibrant and captivating and the Montreux crowd clearly can\u2019t get enough.</p><p>From there, Hooker leads the band and audience through a high-spirited set of his hits and other classics. His funked-out take on Tommy Tucker\u2019s eternal \u201cHi-Heel Sneakers\u201d morphs the 12-bar standard into a trance-inducing pressure cooker drenched in Hooker\u2019s personality and shows off the jamming ability of the group backing him. Of course, Hooker throws down all of his crowd-pleasers, including \u201cBoom Boom,\u201d \u201cCrawlin\u2019 King Snake,\u201d and  \u201cBoogie Chillen,\u201d the latter of which gets stretched into an epic 17-minute blaster that features Luther Allison, Sugar Blue, and an amazing horn section. The show is definitely one of those nights meant to be captured and saved for the ages and upholds every bit of Hooker\u2019s practically mythical stature.</p>","prices":{"regular":29,"premium":21},"tags":["Folk","Alternative Rock","Folk Rock"],"tracks":{"A":[{"title":"It Serves Me Right To Suffer","subtitle":"","duration":"3:48"},{"title":"I Didn\'t Know","subtitle":"","duration":"3:00"},{"title":"Hi-Heel Sneakers","subtitle":"","duration":"4:03"},{"title":"If You Take Care Of Me, I\'ll Take Care Of You","subtitle":"","duration":"3:12"},{"title":"Boom Boom","subtitle":"","duration":"3:02"}],"B":[{"title":"Worried Life Blues","subtitle":"","duration":"4:14"},{"title":"I\'m Jealous","subtitle":"","duration":"3:37"},{"title":"Crawlin\' King Snake","subtitle":"","duration":"4:33"},{"title":"Boogie Chillen\'","subtitle":"","duration":"5:33"}],"C":[{"title":"John Lee Hooker Introduction","subtitle":"","duration":"4:14"},{"title":"Mabel","subtitle":"","duration":"3:37"},{"title":"I\'m In The Mood","subtitle":"","duration":"4:33"},{"title":"Crawlin\' King Snake\'","subtitle":"","duration":"5:33"},{"title":"Baby Lee\'","subtitle":"","duration":"5:33"}],"D":[{"title":"It Serves Me Right To Suffer","subtitle":"","duration":"4:14"},{"title":"Boom Boom","subtitle":"","duration":"3:37"},{"title":"The Healer","subtitle":"","duration":"4:33"},{"title":"Boogie Chillen","subtitle":"","duration":"5:33"}]},"categories":["recent","top"]},{"image":"demo_55.jpg","title":"Weird Feelings","author":"Magick Mountain","releaseDate":"2020-10-23","label":"Rough Trade Shops","format":"Vinyl, LP, Album, Limited Edition, Orange Neon","disks":1,"excerpt":"<p>Gorillaz Present: Song Machine, Season Oneis Gorillaz\u2019 newest concept which started in January 2020, releasing brand new material episodically - as and when it happens \u2013 and has continued throughout the year.</p>","desc":"<p>Gorillaz Present: Song Machine, Season Oneis Gorillaz\u2019 newest concept which started in January 2020, releasing brand new material episodically - as and when it happens \u2013 and has continued throughout the year.

The records were cut and pressed by <strong>Lathecuts</strong> in Arizona using a myriad of techniques to get the most surface noise, pops, crackles, and hiss for your sound design pleasure. In the cutting process they used four different lathes with varying noise floors and records made from many types of materials.</p><p>The library is perfect for use in any project that may need vinyl records to give it that vintage feel! Additionally these samples are great to use in granular processing, music, or to add subtle layers to a burning fire.</p>","prices":{"regular":25,"premium":18},"tags":["Drones & Moods","Hum, Buzz & Glitches","Materials & Texture","Mechanical"],"tracks":{"A":[{"title":"Song Machine: Strange Timez","subtitle":"Featuring Robert Smith","duration":"3:48"},{"title":"The Valley of the Pagans","subtitle":"Featuring Beck","duration":"3:00"},{"title":"The Lost Chord","subtitle":"Featuring Schoolboy Q","duration":"4:03"},{"title":"Pac-Man","subtitle":"Featuring featuring Schoolboy Q","duration":"3:12"},{"title":"Chalk Tablet Towers","subtitle":"Featuring St. Vincent","duration":"3:02"},{"title":"The Pink Phantom","subtitle":"Featuring Elton John and 6lack","duration":"4:13"}],"B":[{"title":"Aries","subtitle":"Featuring Peter Hook and Georgia","duration":"4:14"},{"title":"Friday 13th","subtitle":"Featuring Octavian","duration":"3:37"},{"title":"Dead Butterflies","subtitle":"Featuring Kano and Roxani Arias","duration":"4:33"},{"title":"D\xe9sol\xe9 (Extended version)","subtitle":"Featuring Fatoumata Diawara","duration":"5:33"},{"title":"Momentary Bliss","subtitle":"Featuring Slowthai and Slaves","duration":"3:43"}]},"categories":["newest","recent","top"]},{"image":"demo_64.jpg","title":"Uprising Live!","author":"Bob Marley","releaseDate":"2016-01-29","label":"Capitol","format":"2 x Vinyl, LP, Album","disks":2,"excerpt":"<p>Double vinyl LP pressing. 2015 debut debut full-length album from Troye Sivan.
