'Join us,' they said 'we've heard the Maundy Quintet and we know your work. We need a strong lead guitarist.' There were three in the band - Mike Barnet, the drummer, John Winter, who played keyboards and soprano sax, and Chuck Newcombe, who sang and played bass.'\"</p><p>\"Flow was, without any doubt, what my father would have called a hippie band. They specialized in free-form jazz-rock and were heavily into pot.\"</p><p>The work of John Winter (17) and Don Felder was much admired by fellow Ocala resident, Tom Petty. \"I saw Winter play with Felder at some hippie house party, and it blew my mind how good they were. No more covers. Everything was original. I talked to Don after, and he said, 'We're not going to get anywhere if we don't get record deals, and we are not going to get record deals playing other peoples hits all the time.'\"</p>",

      "desc": "<p>Featuring more than two hours of music, this stunning collection, drawn from tenor saxophone master Rollins’ Netherlands tour of May 1967, will also be presented as a two-CD set, due Dec. 4. The Rollins set succeeds Resonance’s critically acclaimed RSD archival finds from such jazz giants as Bill Evans, Eric Dolphy, and Wes Montgomery. Last November saw the release of the label’s poll-topping 10-LP/seven-CD Nat King Cole box Hittin’ the Ramp: The Early Years (1936-1943).</p><p>Resonance co-president Zev Feldman, known within the industry as “the Jazz Detective,” says of the forthcoming release, “The music on Rollins in Holland is extraordinary. Rollins fans will rejoice when they hear the news of this discovery. These performances follow an important time in his life, and he brought those experiences along with him to make this incredible music.”</p>",

      "excerpt": "<p>Bigger Love[7] is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter and musician John Legend. It was released on June 19, 2020 through Columbia Records and succeeds his 2018 Christmas album A Legendary Christmas. The album includes the singles \"Conversations in the Dark\", \"Actions\", \"Bigger Love\", and \"Wild\". The album was nominated for a Best R&B Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.</p>",
      "desc": "<p>It’s a pretty good time to be John Legend. Since his last album, he scored the Emmy to secure his EGOT, had a second child with model Chrissy Teigen, was awarded an honorary doctorate at Berklee College of Music, and was named Sexiest Man Alive. The album he recorded amid all the success, Bigger Love, is correspondingly upbeat and joyous. He describes it as “vintage sounds with a modern sensibility,” in keeping with a longstanding personal mandate, using love songs as a bridge between the old and new. With this incredibly on-the-nose title, he reminds us both of his devotion to his muse and his limitations: Love might be fathomless, but Legend’s appreciation of it is pretty shallow.</p><p>Legend believes in the power of love the way some believe in Christmas spirit—as a transmissible, irresistible force that extinguishes all negativity. Fittingly, the album reunites him with producer Raphael Saadiq, who was behind his 2018 Christmas album. Legend is pegging his new album, which was recorded primarily in 2019, as a sort of balm for the times. “A lot was going on, but I still felt like people need some uplifting music,” he told Oprah Magazine. “Hopefully it can help them get through what’s been a tough spring, and hopefully this music will help them have a better summer.” Bigger Love is rife with this feel-good energy, buoyed by his stately voice and easygoing charm, but beneath its positive exterior is an emptiness that’s hard to ignore.</p><p>His last album, 2016’s Blake Mills-produced Darkness and Light, had a personality and intimacy that eluded him on previous albums. He was inhabiting songs as a person and not just a dutiful soul man treating the piano bench like a cubicle. They never quite conjured a “What’s Going On,” as they hoped, but Mills brought character to his music. The everymanisms of Love in the Future were replaced with personal reflections, confessions of a “FaceTime abuser,” and the politically minded expressiveness of a man clinging to hope in a darkening world; Legend’s songs were suddenly richer and more textured.</p><p>Bigger Love reverts to a vacant pantomime and a less robust R&B palette courtesy of producers like Oak, Ryan Tedder, and Ricky Reed. His 2019 protest song, “Preach,” is curiously absent here; so, too, is the effortless tonal blend of the album’s predecessor. This marriage of vintage and modern goes awry, as Bigger Love opens with a trap take on doo-wop and closes with a Mr. Hudson ballad. Following the lead of his Oscar partner Common, Bigger Love is risk-averse and platitudinous. There’s a derivative YOLO song called “One Life” and the hook couldn’t be more uninspired: “We’ve got one life/I won’t waste it, one life/I’m gon’ taste the joy in every minute/Beginning’ ‘til the finish,” he sings. Not even Anderson .Paak’s smooth funk can save it. If the album’s tacky acoustic lead single, “Conversations in the Dark,” sounds like a not-so-subtle sync for a tear-jerker network drama, that’s because it pretty much is.</p><p>No song here is transcendent enough to join “All of Me” in wedding-first-dance canon, nor is there a moment as touching and emotionally honest as “Right By You (for Luna),” the song he wrote for his newborn daughter on Darkness and Light, where he wonders aloud how she’ll receive and be received by the world, the quiver in his tone carrying a father’s anxiety. “Actions” fails to live up to its brazen “The Edge” sample, so clearly repurposed to call to mind Dr. Dre’s “The Next Episode” that its appeal is lost to sense memory, and the song’s core directive (“actions speak louder than love songs”) goes largely unheeded.</p><p>Even working within the confines of his safe space, though, John Legend can remind you why Kanye built a label around him, and Bigger Love is sustained by such moments. He works well in collaboration with bluesman Gary Clark Jr. (“Wild”), psychedelic R&B singer Jhené Aiko (“U Move, I Move”), rap technician Rapsody (“Remember Us”), and reggae artist Koffee (“Don’t Walk Away”) on tracks that stretch his songcraft in different directions—anthemic pop rock, alt-R&B, neo soul, and dancehall lite. The attempts are bold by his standards, and he slots into each one confidently. “Favorite Place” is the kind of sexy-time jam befitting a new dad. He plays to his strengths on “Slow Cooker,” a quirky little song that likens brimming sensuality to the simmer of a crock-pot, letting the resonance of his timbre give shape to his phrases. On the understated “Focused,” the confusion produced by a noisy outside world falls away when under his wife’s thrall. Plain and folksy, it has the characteristics of a Bill Withers song: The simplicity of the lyrics mirrors how uncomplicated things are in her company. Suddenly, the uplifting power he’s been preaching about is in full effect.</p>",

      "desc": "<p>The John Lee Hooker Estate does the world’s blues fans a solid by releasing the posthumous double-live set John Lee Hooker Live at Montreux 1983 & 1990. The album drops November 6th, 2020 thanks to Eagle Rock Entertainment and will be available as a 2-LP set, digital video, and digital audio. The record captures Hooker at his boogie-king best in two distinct performances at the legendary Montreux Jazz Festival in 1983 and 1990, rocking the joint with the help of The Coast To Coast Blues Band and guest appearances by the late guitarist Luther Allison and Grammy-winning harmonica star Sugar Blue. Located in Switzerland, the Montreux Jazz Festival is one of the world’s biggest and longest-running jazz festivals and hearing this lineup of blues royalty heating up its stage is a musical indulgence of the highest order.</p><p>Four-time Grammy Award winner and Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award recipient John Lee Hooker will always be remembered as one of the most unique and compelling artists that blues music has ever produced. His debut single, “Boogie Chillen,” rose to #1 on the R&B charts in 1949, selling over a million copies. Hooker was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. In 2008, “Boogie Chillen” was added to the National Recording Registry by the Library Of Congress as a song that is “culturally, historically, or aesthetically important, and/or inform(s) or reflect(s) life in the United States.” Hooker instinctively recast the blues in his own image, doing away with the restrictive 12-bar structure and taking the music to a deeper, funkier, and more personal place. He has influenced every generation of musicians to follow him and his artistic DNA has become immortal.</p><p>The 1983 show kicks off with a simmering version of Hooker’s mid-60s single “Serves Me Right To Suffer.” The Coast To Coast Blues Band puts down John Lee’s signature style of hypnotic rhythm behind him and Hooker works his minimalist magic on the assembled fans. The Hook has always defined what cool is all about and that presence is in full force here from the moment he hits the stage. He’s vibrant and captivating and the Montreux crowd clearly can’t get enough.</p><p>From there, Hooker leads the band and audience through a high-spirited set of his hits and other classics. His funked-out take on Tommy Tucker’s eternal “Hi-Heel Sneakers” morphs the 12-bar standard into a trance-inducing pressure cooker drenched in Hooker’s personality and shows off the jamming ability of the group backing him. Of course, Hooker throws down all of his crowd-pleasers, including “Boom Boom,” “Crawlin’ King Snake,” and  “Boogie Chillen,” the latter of which gets stretched into an epic 17-minute blaster that features Luther Allison, Sugar Blue, and an amazing horn section. The show is definitely one of those nights meant to be captured and saved for the ages and upholds every bit of Hooker’s practically mythical stature.</p>",

Rollins fans will rejoice when they hear the news of this discovery. These performances follow an important time in his life, and he brought those experiences along with him to make this incredible music.”</p>",

      "desc": "<p>The John Lee Hooker Estate does the world’s blues fans a solid by releasing the posthumous double-live set John Lee Hooker Live at Montreux 1983 & 1990. The album drops November 6th, 2020 thanks to Eagle Rock Entertainment and will be available as a 2-LP set, digital video, and digital audio. The record captures Hooker at his boogie-king best in two distinct performances at the legendary Montreux Jazz Festival in 1983 and 1990, rocking the joint with the help of The Coast To Coast Blues Band and guest appearances by the late guitarist Luther Allison and Grammy-winning harmonica star Sugar Blue. Located in Switzerland, the Montreux Jazz Festival is one of the world’s biggest and longest-running jazz festivals and hearing this lineup of blues royalty heating up its stage is a musical indulgence of the highest order.</p><p>Four-time Grammy Award winner and Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award recipient John Lee Hooker will always be remembered as one of the most unique and compelling artists that blues music has ever produced. His debut single, “Boogie Chillen,” rose to #1 on the R&B charts in 1949, selling over a million copies. Hooker was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. In 2008, “Boogie Chillen” was added to the National Recording Registry by the Library Of Congress as a song that is “culturally, historically, or aesthetically important, and/or inform(s) or reflect(s) life in the United States.” Hooker instinctively recast the blues in his own image, doing away with the restrictive 12-bar structure and taking the music to a deeper, funkier, and more personal place. He has influenced every generation of musicians to follow him and his artistic DNA has become immortal.</p><p>The 1983 show kicks off with a simmering version of Hooker’s mid-60s single “Serves Me Right To Suffer.” The Coast To Coast Blues Band puts down John Lee’s signature style of hypnotic rhythm behind him and Hooker works his minimalist magic on the assembled fans. The Hook has always defined what cool is all about and that presence is in full force here from the moment he hits the stage. He’s vibrant and captivating and the Montreux crowd clearly can’t get enough.</p><p>From there, Hooker leads the band and audience through a high-spirited set of his hits and other classics. His funked-out take on Tommy Tucker’s eternal “Hi-Heel Sneakers” morphs the 12-bar standard into a trance-inducing pressure cooker drenched in Hooker’s personality and shows off the jamming ability of the group backing him. Of course, Hooker throws down all of his crowd-pleasers, including “Boom Boom,” “Crawlin’ King Snake,” and  “Boogie Chillen,” the latter of which gets stretched into an epic 17-minute blaster that features Luther Allison, Sugar Blue, and an amazing horn section. The show is definitely one of those nights meant to be captured and saved for the ages and upholds every bit of Hooker’s practically mythical stature.</p>",

The records were cut and pressed by <strong>Lathecuts</strong> in Arizona using a myriad of techniques to get the most surface noise, pops, crackles, and hiss for your sound design pleasure. In the cutting process they used four different lathes with varying noise floors and records made from many types of materials.</p><p>The library is perfect for use in any project that may need vinyl records to give it that vintage feel! Additionally these samples are great to use in granular processing, music, or to add subtle layers to a burning fire.</p>",

The records were cut and pressed by <strong>Lathecuts</strong> in Arizona using a myriad of techniques to get the most surface noise, pops, crackles, and hiss for your sound design pleasure. In the cutting process they used four different lathes with varying noise floors and records made from many types of materials.</p><p>The library is perfect for use in any project that may need vinyl records to give it that vintage feel! Additionally these samples are great to use in granular processing, music, or to add subtle layers to a burning fire.</p>",
